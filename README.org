#+title: My Doom Emacs Config

#+begin_quote
Note: This config is ONLY tested and WILL ONLY WORK on my machine!

If you want to use it, MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND what I have written!

You need to edit ALL paths in `config.el` in order to let the config works.

I tuned my emacs for LaTeX writing in Org-Mode in the following aspect:
+ Org-Mode LaTeX preview
+ Org-Mode LaTeX export
+ Org-Mode TiKZ preview
+ Org-Mode LaTeX citation

This config is highly intergrated with [[https://github.com/Gunale0926/math_commands][math_commands.tex]].

Make sure you have cloned it first!
